### Connection Troubleshooting

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** If VS Code doesn't load properly, try refreshing the browser or clearing your browser cache.

> **ðŸš¨ Warning:** Keep your Workshop Studio session active. If you close the tab, you can return using the same email address.

#### Common Issues

**VS Code won't load:**
- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
- Try an incognito/private browsing window

**Can't paste commands:**
- For Firefox users: Enable clipboard permissions in `about:config`
- Set these to `true`: `dom.events.asyncClipboard.clipboardItem`, `dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText`, `dom.events.testing.asyncClipboard`

**Lost connection:**
- Return to Workshop Studio using the same email
- Your environment and progress are preserved
- Click the IdeUrl again to reconnect

## Verifying Your Environment

Once connected to VS Code, verify your environment is ready:

1. **Open the Terminal**
   - Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) or use View > Terminal
   - You should see a bash prompt

2. **Check AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```
   You should see AWS CLI version information.

3. **Verify Workshop Materials**
   - In the file explorer, you should see a `workshop-assets` folder
   - This contains all the workshop materials

4. **Test Markdown Preview**
   - Open any `.md` file from the workshop-assets folder
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to open preview mode
   - You should see formatted content
