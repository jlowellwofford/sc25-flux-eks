## Working with Markdown Files

### Opening Files
1. Click on any `.md` file in the file explorer
2. The file opens in source view by default
3. Use preview mode for better readability (see below)

### Markdown Preview Mode
**Essential for this workshop!** Preview mode renders markdown with proper formatting, images, and clickable links.

**Ways to open preview:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+V` - Open preview in current tab
- `Ctrl+K V` - Open preview side-by-side with source
- Right-click file â†’ "Open Preview"

### Navigation Between Files
- **Click links**: In preview mode, click any link to navigate
- **Breadcrumbs**: Use the breadcrumb navigation at the top of each file
- **File explorer**: Browse the folder structure
- **Quick open**: Press `Ctrl+P` and type filename

## Workshop Navigation Strategy

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Start with overview**: Always read the module README first
2. **Follow the sequence**: Use numbered files (01-, 02-, etc.) in order
3. **Use breadcrumbs**: Navigate up/down the hierarchy as needed
4. **Keep terminal ready**: Have the integrated terminal open for commands

### Following Links
- **Internal links**: Click to navigate between workshop sections
- **External links**: Open in new browser tab (Ctrl+click)
- **Command blocks**: Copy commands to the terminal

### Managing Multiple Files
- **Side-by-side**: Open instructions in preview, keep terminal visible
- **Multiple tabs**: Keep related files open in tabs
- **Split editor**: Use `Ctrl+\` to split the editor for multiple views

## Tips for Success

### Reading Workshop Content
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Always use markdown preview mode for workshop materials. The formatting, images, and navigation work much better in preview.

### Running Commands
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Copy commands from the preview mode and paste them into the integrated terminal. This ensures accuracy and saves time.

### Staying Organized
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Follow the numbered sequence in each module. The content builds progressively, and skipping sections may cause issues.

### Getting Help
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** If you get lost, return to the main [workshop README](../README.md) or the current module's README for orientation.

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Working
- Ensure you're viewing a `.md` file
- Try `Ctrl+Shift+V` to toggle preview
- Check that the file isn't corrupted

### Links Not Clickable
- Make sure you're in preview mode, not source view
- Links only work in markdown preview

### Can't Find Files
- Use `Ctrl+P` and start typing the filename
- Check the file explorer for the correct folder structure
- Ensure you're in the `workshop-assets` directory

### Terminal Issues
- Press `Ctrl+`` to toggle terminal visibility
- Create a new terminal with `Ctrl+Shift+``
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`pwd` to check)
