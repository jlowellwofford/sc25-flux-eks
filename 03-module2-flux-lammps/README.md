## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1
- Understanding of HPC job scheduling concepts

## Estimated Time

## Tutorial

### Setup

Your eksctl cluster that we used in Module 1 is already created. We need to install the cluster autoscaler to allow for scaling to 2 nodes. 

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./configs/cluster-autoscaler.yaml
```

When the cluster is created, install the Flux Operator. Note that this is an ARM build since we are running on an AWS Graviton (ARM) processor.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/refs/heads/main/examples/dist/flux-operator-arm.yaml
```

It is easier to have auto-completion for kubectl. If you haven't done this yet:

```bash
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```

## LAMMPS MiniCluster as a Job

A Flux Framework MiniCluster is akin to running an entire Flux Cluster across some number of physical nodes in Kubernetes. 
We create it with a custom resource definition (CRD).

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./configs/minicluster-job.yaml
```

If you have not scaled the nodes of your cluster up yet, here is how to ensure that the cluster is autoscaling.

<details>

<summary>Checking the autoscaler</summary>

See that one is Init/Running, and one is Pending

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Describe pods to see the events for pending. 

```bash
kubectl describe pods
```

Look at the cluster autoscaler log (press tab to autocomplete to the full pod name)

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system cluster-autoscaler-[TAB]
```

Finally, when you see the scaling event is triggered, watch for the node to be ready.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

</details>

You can watch the progress, either as a one of check or with watch for persistence. 
This LAMMPS image takes approximately one minute to pull.
Here is how to view pods, and watch for changes:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods --watch
```

The `Init:0/1` is running initialization containers to prepare the Flux View using [Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/). When you see `PodsInitializing` this usually is primarily containers pulling for our main application. The `Running` state indicates our cluster is ready to interact with or the job is running. Since this is running a one-off command, it means the MiniCluster is acting like a Job with state. It will be Running, and then Complete. When it is Running you can monitor it via the lead broker (index 0 of the [Indexed Job](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/19/introducing-indexed-jobs/) set, which is launching the job). Note that we can add the `-f` to ensure it keeps running.

```bash
kubectl logs lammps-job-0-dl4dm -f
```

The pods will reach status Complete. This is a feature of a Kubernetes Job. The pod is no longer consuming cluster resources, but is left for inspection.  

```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
lammps-job-0-dl4dm   0/1     Completed   0          5m19s
lammps-job-1-447xz   0/1     Completed   0          5m19s
```

When you are done, clean up. This will remove the pods from the listing, and is good practice.

```bash
kubectl delete -f ./configs/minicluster-job.yaml
```

### Interactive MiniCluster

What if you want to run an HPC workload, but shell into the cluster to interact with it? 
You may want to test the submission, inspect data outputs, or otherwise interact. 
The Flux Operator has an interactive mode that turns your Job into an interactive environment. 
We can make one small change to the MiniCluster custom resource definition to make it interactive:

```diff
+ interactive: true
```

Let's create our interactive LAMMPS Job.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./configs/minicluster-interactive.yaml
```

When the pods are Running, shell in to the lead broker pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it lammps-interactive-xxxxx -- bash
```
Source some environment variables to easily expose the Flux socket and update paths, etc.

```bash
. /mnt/flux/flux-view.sh
```

We now are going to connect to our running Flux instance. The Flux instance was started when we brought up the cluster. The pod you are working on is the lead broker, the top of a tree that the worker nodes are connecting to with ZeroMQ. The way we will connect is via a filesystem socket. We use the command `flux proxy` to do that, and the path to the socket is automatically derived for us. Here is how to connect to your Flux instance:

```bash
flux proxy $fluxsocket bash
```

You'll then have a full cluster (the resources will match what you are given). We can use `flux resource list` to see our resources.

```bash
# flux resource list
     STATE NNODES   NCORES    NGPUS NODELIST
      free      2      128        0 lammps-interactive-[0-1]
 allocated      0        0        0 
      down      0        0        0 
```

Then run LAMMPS, this time using flux directly.

```bash
flux run -N2 -n 128 -o cpu-affinity=per-task lmp -v x 8 -v y 8 -v z 8 -in in.reaxff.hns -nocite
```

You can also `flux submit` the same for a non-blocking interaction. When you are done, exit from the interface and:

```bash
kubectl delete -f ./configs/minicluster-interactive.yaml
```

<!--0### Side Quests

- See if you can figure out what the standard LAMMPS Figure of Merit (FOM) is in the output.
- Test running the job with affinity (as we did) and then removing the flag for setting CPU affinity (`-o cpu-affinity=per-task` or setting to `none`. What differences do you see? What do you think is happening?
-->

### Helm Install

We can also install everything via the helm package manager. This is the same LAMMPS, but with the addition of running 3 iterations, and asking for additional log output from Flux.

```bash
helm install \
  --set minicluster.efa=1 \
  --set minicluster.size=2 \
  --set experiment.nodes=2 \
  --set experiment.tasks=128 \
  --set experiment.iterations=3 \
  --set lammps.x=8 \
  --set lammps.y=8 \
  --set lammps.z=8 \
  --set minicluster.save_logs=true \
  --set minicluster.image=ghcr.io/converged-computing/lammps-reax-efa:ubuntu2404-efa \
  --set flux.image=ghcr.io/converged-computing/flux-view-rocky:arm-9 \
lammps oci://ghcr.io/converged-computing/flux-apps-helm-lammps-reax/chart --version 0.1.0
```

Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes. We have developed several HPC applications there, and you can see them in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-apps-helm). To see output, we will do the same command. The helm charts provide an ability to run experiments with more structured output and additional metadata from Flux.

```bash
kubectl logs lammps-0-g2ggm -f
```

When you are done:

```bash
helm uninstall lammps
```

### Advanced Scheduling Scenarios

TBA

- Can we do something with fluxbind (topology) if it's ready? Or do the side quests go here?

You are done with this module. If you would like to use or modify the LAMMPS container, we have provided the Docker build assets in [docker](docker). Use the navigation below to move to the next module.
