# Orchestrating Complex HPC and AI/ML Workflows on Kubernetes Using Flux and AWS

**SC25 Tutorial tut158s3**

Welcome to the workshop materials for "Orchestrating Complex HPC and AI/ML Workflows on Kubernetes Using Flux and AWS". This tutorial will teach you how Flux's hierarchical resource management and graph-based scheduling capabilities extend Kubernetes to support diverse workflows.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using VS Code for This Workshop

This workshop is designed to be completed using VS Code in your browser. All materials are provided as markdown files that you can view in VS Code's built-in preview mode.

#### How to Navigate These Materials

1. **Opening Files**: Click on any `.md` file in the VS Code file explorer
2. **Preview Mode**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (or `Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac) to open markdown preview
3. **Side-by-Side**: Press `Ctrl+K V` to open preview alongside the source
4. **Following Links**: Click any link in the preview to navigate between sections

#### VS Code Tips for This Workshop

- **Integrated Terminal**: Use `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the terminal
- **File Explorer**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+E` to focus on the file explorer
- **Quick Open**: Use `Ctrl+P` to quickly open files by name
- **Zoom**: Use `Ctrl++` and `Ctrl+-` to adjust text size

## üìö Workshop Structure

This workshop progresses from foundational infrastructure concepts to advanced Flux capabilities, culminating in deploying MuMMI (Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure)‚Äîa scientific workflow exemplifying emerging complexity through combined large-scale simulations and machine learning.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

![Flux+EKS Architecture](images/aws-eks/eks-hpc-architecture.png)

The workshop demonstrates how to orchestrate complex workflows using:
- **Amazon EKS**: Managed Kubernetes service
- **Flux**: Advanced job scheduling and resource management
- **FSx for Lustre**: High-performance parallel file system
- **GROMACS**: Molecular dynamics simulation software
- **MuMMI**: Multiscale machine learning infrastructure

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

1. **Understand** how to deploy and manage HPC workloads on Kubernetes
2. **Learn** Flux's hierarchical resource management capabilities
3. **Experience** running real scientific applications (GROMACS, LAMMPS)
4. **Explore** integration of HPC simulations with machine learning workflows
5. **Gain** hands-on experience with AWS services for HPC

## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
- Understanding of command-line interfaces
- AWS account access (provided during the workshop)
- No prior experience with Flux or HPC required
