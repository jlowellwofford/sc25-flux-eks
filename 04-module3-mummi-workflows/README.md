# Module 3: MuMMI Workflows

[Home](../README.md) > Module 3: MuMMI Workflows

## Overview

This module focuses on deploying MuMMI (Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure), a scientific workflow that combines large-scale simulations with machine learning to exemplify emerging complexity in HPC and AI/ML workflows.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** - This module is currently under development.

## Planned Contents

### 1. MuMMI Components
- The MLRunner component
- Simulation steps and workflow orchestration

### 2. MuMMI as a State Machine
- Workflow state management
- Complex dependency handling
- Integration with Flux scheduling

### 3. Advanced Topics
- Hackathon challenges
- Performance optimization
- Scaling considerations

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of machine learning workflows
- Familiarity with scientific computing pipelines

## Estimated Time

TBD
