# Module 4: Deploy Adventure

[Home](../README.md) > Module 4: Deploy Adventure

## Overview

You are now a deploy expert for Flux Framework MiniClusters! But oh no, Flux Bird 🦩 has been up to no good, and has edited the manifest! Your task is to deploy the manifest, an adventure that will require a sharp eye and using everything that you've learned. 

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/refs/heads/main/examples/dist/flux-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./minicluster.yaml
```

Good luck!
